<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p><em>Snatch</em> is yet another transport service provider trying to vie for a place in the public transport arena.</p>
<p><em>Snatch</em> provides three types of ride services:
<tt>JustRide</tt>, <tt>TakeACab</tt> and <tt>ShareARide</tt>.

</p><p>There are also different types of drivers under <em>Snatch</em>.  Each can provide a subset of the services above.</p>

<p>A customer can issue a <em>Snatch</em> ride request, specified by the distance of the ride,  the number of passengers,  and the time of the request.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>

<p>You shall be given a request, followed by a list of <tt>NormalCab</tt> or <tt>PrivateCar</tt> drivers together with their corresponding waiting times. 
</p><p>The task is to provide a list of <!-- a list of possible --> bookings (a pairing of a driver with the request) in order of increasing fares by matching the available drivers based on the services they provide to the given request.  
</p><p>Break ties among the same lowest fares by selecting the booking with the smaller waiting time.</p>

<h2>Take note!</h2>

<p>There are altogether five levels. You are required to complete ALL levels.

</p><p>You should keep to the constructs and programming discipline instilled throughout the module.

</p><ul>
<li>Write each class/interface in its own file.
</li><li>Ensure that ALL object properties and class constants are declared private final.
</li><li>Ensure that that your classes are NOT cyclic dependent.
</li><li>Use only java libraries taught in class.
<!--    
You are NOT allowed to use java libraries, other than those from <tt>java.lang</tt>, <tt>java.util.List</tt> and <tt>java.util.Comparator</tt>.
-->
</li><li>You are NOT allowed to use java keywords/literals: <tt>null</tt>, instanceof (except within the typical <tt>equals</tt> method)
</li><li>You are NOT allowed to use Java reflection, i.e. <tt>Object::getClasses</tt> and other methods from <tt>java.lang.Class</tt>
</li><li>You are NOT allowed to use <tt>*</tt> wildcard imports.
<!-- You are NOT allowed to define anonymous inner classes, or lambdas.-->
</li><li>You are NOT allowed to define array constructs, e.g. <tt>String[]</tt> or using ellipsis, e.g. <tt>String...</tt>
</li></ul>

<p>You may assume that all tests provide valid arguments to methods; hence there is no need to validate method arguments.

</p><h2>Level 1</h2>

<p>The fare of a service is based upon the distance travelled, the
number of passengers, and the time of the service.

</p><p>JustRide is one such service:

</p><ul>
<li>Fare is based on the distance <tt>@ 22</tt> cents per km </li>
<li>Fare is the same regardless of the number of passengers (pax) </li>
<li>There is no booking fee. </li>
<li>A surcharge of 500 cents if a ride request is issued between the peak hour of <tt>600</tt> hrs to <tt>900</tt> hrs, both inclusive </li>
</ul>

<p>Create the <tt>JustRide</tt> service with <tt>computeFare</tt>
method the takes in three integer arguments comprising the distance,
number of passengers, and time of service.
The method returns the fare in cents.

</p><pre>$ javac your_java_files
$ jshell your_java_files_in_bottom-up_dependency_order
jshell&gt; new JustRide()
$.. ==&gt; JustRide

jshell&gt; new JustRide().computeFare(20, 3, 1000)
$.. ==&gt; 440

jshell&gt; new JustRide().computeFare(10, 1, 900)
$.. ==&gt; 720
</pre>

<h2>Level 2</h2>
<p>Define a <tt>Request</tt> class that encapsulates the distance, number of passengers, and time.
Write a method <tt>computeFare</tt> that takes in a service and returns the fare accordingly.

<!--
Include the <tt>getDistance</tt>, <tt>getNumOfPassengers</tt> and <tt>getTime</tt> methods to return the corresponding values.
<p>Note that the <tt>Request</tt> class serves to only store data in a meaning manner for easy retrieval later.  
Hence the accessor (or getter) methods are part of its responsibility.

-->

</p><pre>$ javac your_java_files
$ jshell your_java_files_in_bottom-up_dependency_order
jshell&gt; new Request(20, 3, 1000)
$.. ==&gt; 20km for 3pax @ 1000hrs

jshell&gt; new Request(20, 3, 1000).computeFare(new JustRide())
$.. ==&gt; 440

jshell&gt; new Request(10, 1, 900)
request ==&gt; 10km for 1pax @ 900hrs

jshell&gt; new Request(10, 1, 900).computeFare(new JustRide())
$.. ==&gt; 720
</pre>

<p>In addition, include the <tt>TakeACab</tt> service:

</p><ul>
<li>Fare is based on the distance <tt>@ 33</tt> cents per km, but there is a booking fee of 200 cents </li>
<li>Fare is the same regardless of the number of passengers (pax) </li>
<li>No peak hour surcharge </li>
</ul>

<!-- Note that every service needs to implement the <tt>computeFare</tt> method that returns the fare in cents.</p> -->

<pre>jshell&gt; new TakeACab()
$.. ==&gt; TakeACab

jshell&gt; new Request(20, 3, 1000).computeFare(new TakeACab())
$.. ==&gt; 860

jshell&gt; new Request(10, 1, 900).computeFare(new TakeACab())
$.. ==&gt; 530
</pre>

<h2>Level 3</h2>
<p>Now, include a <tt>NormalCab</tt> driver who is identified by its license plate number (a string) and the passenger waiting time in minutes.
<tt>NormalCab</tt> drivers provide <tt>JustRide</tt> and <tt>TakeACab</tt> services.

</p><p>Then, add a <tt>Booking</tt> class that takes in a driver and a request.  From the services that a driver provides, the best service with the lowest fare is selected.</p>

<p>To compare two bookings using their computed fare, we let the
<tt>Booking</tt> class implement the <tt>Comparable</tt> interface
that specifies a <tt>compareTo</tt> method to be implemented.
(note that this is different from the <tt>Comparator</tt> interface).

</p><pre>class Booking implements Comparable&lt;Booking&gt; {
   ...
   @Override
   public int compareTo(Booking other) {
      ...
   }
}
</pre>

Note that if both fares are the same, we prefer the one with the shorter waiting time.<p></p>

<pre>$ javac your_java_files
$ jshell your_java_files_in_bottom-up_dependency_order
jshell&gt; new NormalCab("SHA1234", 5)
$.. ==&gt; SHA1234 (5 mins away) NormalCab

jshell&gt; new Booking(new NormalCab("SHA1234", 5), new Request(20, 3, 1000))
.. ==&gt; $4.40 using SHA1234 (5 mins away) NormalCab (JustRide)

jshell&gt; new NormalCab("SHA2345", 10)
$.. ==&gt; SHA2345 (10 mins away) NormalCab

jshell&gt; new Booking(new NormalCab("SHA2345", 10), new Request(10, 1, 900))
.. ==&gt; $5.30 using SHA2345 (10 mins away) NormalCab (TakeACab)

jshell&gt; Booking b1 = new Booking(new NormalCab("SHA2345", 10), new Request(10, 1, 900))
b1 ==&gt; $5.30 using SHA2345 (10 mins away) NormalCab (TakeACab)

jshell&gt; Booking b2 = new Booking(new NormalCab("SHA2345", 10), new Request(10, 1, 900))
b2 ==&gt; $5.30 using SHA2345 (10 mins away) NormalCab (TakeACab)

jshell&gt; Comparable&lt;Booking&gt; cmp = b1
cmp ==&gt; $5.30 using SHA2345 (10 mins away) NormalCab (TakeACab)

jshell&gt; b1.compareTo(b2) == 0
$.. ==&gt; true

jshell&gt; Booking b3 = new Booking(new NormalCab("SHA1234", 5), new Request(10, 1, 900))
b3 ==&gt; $5.30 using SHA1234 (5 mins away) NormalCab (TakeACab)

jshell&gt; Booking b4 = new Booking(new NormalCab("SHA2345", 10), new Request(10, 1, 900))
b4 ==&gt; $5.30 using SHA2345 (10 mins away) NormalCab (TakeACab)

jshell&gt; b3.compareTo(b4) &lt; 0
$.. ==&gt; true
</pre>

<h2>Level 4</h2>
<p>Now include the <tt>ShareARide</tt> service:

</p><ul>
<li>Fare is based on the distance <tt>@ 50</tt> cents per km </li>
<li>A surcharge of 500 cents if a ride request is issued between <tt>600</tt> hrs to <tt>900</tt> hrs, both inclusive </li>
<li>There is no booking fee</li>
<li>The total fare is divided equally among the number of passengers </li>
<li>Any fractional part of the fare is absorbed by your friendly driver </li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, include </p><li><tt>PrivateCar</tt> drivers that provide <tt>JustRide</tt> and <tt>ShareARide</tt> services.


<p>You should aim to make the <tt>Booking</tt> class general such that it does not need to check for any invalid pairing, say between <tt>PrivateCar</tt> driver and <tt>TakeACab</tt> service. If you have designed your program appropriately, then extending your program with additional drivers and services would not require any modification to existing classes.  <!-- Note that you can make the <tt>Booking</tt> class general and therefore need not check for the invalid pairing between  <tt>PrivateCar</tt> driver and <tt>TakeACab</tt> service , as well as between <tt>NormalCab</tt> driver and <tt>ShareARide</tt> service.  You can leave the logic of ensuring valid pairing to Level 5.    -->  <!--
<p>The following is a sample run of the program.  User input is <u>underlined</u>.    Ensure that the last line of output is followed by a newline character. --></p>

<pre>$ javac your_java_files
$ jshell your_java_files_in_bottom-up_dependency_order
jshell&gt; new ShareARide()
$.. ==&gt; ShareARide

jshell&gt; new PrivateCar("SMA7890", 5)
$.. ==&gt; SMA7890 (5 mins away) PrivateCar

jshell&gt; new Booking(new PrivateCar("SMA7890", 5), new Request(20, 3, 1000))
.. ==&gt; $3.33 using SMA7890 (5 mins away) PrivateCar (ShareARide)

jshell&gt; new PrivateCar("SLA5678", 10)
$.. ==&gt; SLA5678 (10 mins away) PrivateCar

jshell&gt; new Booking(new PrivateCar("SLA5678", 10), new Request(10, 1, 900))
.. ==&gt; $7.20 using SLA5678 (10 mins away) PrivateCar (JustRide)

jshell&gt; Booking b1 = new Booking(new PrivateCar("SMA7890", 5), new Request(10, 1, 900))
b1 ==&gt; $7.20 using SMA7890 (5 mins away) PrivateCar (JustRide)

jshell&gt; Booking b2 = new Booking(new PrivateCar("SLA5678", 10), new Request(10, 1, 900))
b2 ==&gt; $7.20 using SLA5678 (10 mins away) PrivateCar (JustRide)

jshell&gt; b1.compareTo(b2) &lt; 0
$.. ==&gt; true
</pre>
<!-- In practice, we should make the <tt>Booking</tt> constructor private to prevent a caller from passing in an invalid pair of driver and service, but that would make it harder for us to test your code for the purpose of the assessment. -->

<h2>Level 5</h2>
<p>Now complete the task by defining the <tt>findBestBooking</tt>
method in <tt>Main.java</tt> that returns the list of booking matches sorted by increasing fare (breaking ties by waiting time).</p>

<p>You may assume that no two bookings have the same fare and the same waiting time.</p>

<pre>jshell&gt; /open Main.java

jshell&gt; findBestBooking(new Request(20, 3, 1000),
   ...&gt; List.of(new NormalCab("SHA1234", 5), new PrivateCar("SMA7890", 10))).
   ...&gt; forEach(booking -&gt; System.out.println(booking))
$3.33 using SMA7890 (10 mins away) PrivateCar (ShareARide)
$4.40 using SHA1234 (5 mins away) NormalCab (JustRide)
$4.40 using SMA7890 (10 mins away) PrivateCar (JustRide)
$8.60 using SHA1234 (5 mins away) NormalCab (TakeACab)

jshell&gt; findBestBooking(new Request(10, 1, 900),
   ...&gt; List.of(new NormalCab("SHA1234", 5), new PrivateCar("SMA7890", 10))).
   ...&gt; forEach(booking -&gt; System.out.println(booking))
$5.30 using SHA1234 (5 mins away) NormalCab (TakeACab)
$7.20 using SHA1234 (5 mins away) NormalCab (JustRide)
$7.20 using SMA7890 (10 mins away) PrivateCar (JustRide)
$10.00 using SMA7890 (10 mins away) PrivateCar (ShareARide)
